These are the example files for my presentation about GitLab + Kubernetes for Continuous Integration and Delivery.
The files are also mainly used in my GitLab post series about the GitLab CI runners.

**INFO** This isn't the best way to deploy to K8s, this is a more of an example how simple it can be.

The presentation can be found here: [Kubernetes - WYNTK - GitLab CI + Kubernetes Presentation](https://edenmal.net/2017/07/31/Kubernetes-WYNTK-GitLab-CI-Kubernetes-Presentation/).
